# watersort-solver
## Summary
Water Sort is a popular mobile game. You can play it online [here](https://www.safekidgames.com/water-sort/).
This program was designed to, after giving the colours and positions for each vial, give the correct series of steps to solve the level. It is especially useful when the puzzle has above ten vials, as it can sometimes become difficult to solve otherwise.

## Tools
This app was developed with NodeJS and React. It was bootstrapped with Create React App and uses Tailwind for styles. The solving algorithm was originally written in Python and copied across to Javascript.

## Local setup
To set up and run this project locally, there are two options:
1. The python script is attached. Open `main.py`, replace the variable `example_board` with an array of the board, and run the script.

2. A web version (demonstration found [here](https://hugojjohnson.github.io/watersort-solver/)) was developed with NodeJS.
